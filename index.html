    <p>I am a cybersecurity major and I think this is my fifth semester. I don't know, I lost count. I play games with the boys and hit the gym
        when I am bored. Am single but currently accepting applications to fill that role. Hit me up (480) 809-8842. Since I am in cybersecurity,
        a lot of the positions are making sure that the clients servers are safe and that random people can't exploit webpages to get unauthorized
        information. So knowing how webapges and specifically how web servers are setup, will definitely help me out in the future. Also just knowing
        HTML is nice. I have been a member my whole life. Got back from my mission almost 2 years ago from the Houston East Mission. Anyway, hit me up
        if you want squad up sometime!!
